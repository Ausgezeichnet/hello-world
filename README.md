Hello. I am Teddy Spear, and I am planning to use GitHub to help me with my programming. :rabbit: :shipit:
Some things I have used GitHub for:
  - [x] Uploading files to save
  - [x] Making new branches so that I could make edits better
  - [x] Merging branches with pull requests

Also, GitHub has motivated me to:
  * learn the following Git commands:
  ```
  git status
  
  git remote add origin
  
  git commit
  
  git pull
  
  git add 
  
  git push
  ```
  * Believe it or not, GitHub has motivated me to learn better Markdown! Here are some ways:
    * Comments
    * This text you are reading right now is styled with Markdown this way from things I learned using the [GitHub Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax webpage] (https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/ )

I found that another good webpage is the [Mastering Markdown] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) webpage. Also, you might want to check out the [Emoji Cheat Sheet] (http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).
Here is something I researched about what happens in GitHub :scroll: :

1. Make new branch
2. Work on files
3. Commit changes
4. Start a pull request
	1. Compare
		* If any bugs, fix them
	2. Create the pull request when everything you want is changed
	3. Give it a name and describe it
5. Merge the branch you created to the master branch
6. Delete the branch you created when merging is done
