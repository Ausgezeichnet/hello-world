Hello. I am Teddy Spear, and I am planning to use GitHub to help me with my programming. :shipit:
Some things I have used GitHub for:
  - [x] Uploading files to save
  - [x] Making new branches so that I could make edits better
  - [x] Merging branches with pull requests

Also, GitHub has motivated me to:
  * learn the following Git commands:
  ```
  git status
  
  git remote add origin
  
  git commit
  
  git pull
  
  git add 
  
  git push
  ```
  * Believe it or not, GitHub has motivated me to learn better Markdown! Here are some ways:
    * Comments
    * This text you are reading right now is styled with Markdown this way from things I learned using the [GitHub Basic Writing and Formatting Syntax webpage] (https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/ )
  * Get more serious about programming
