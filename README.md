Hello. I am Teddy Spear, and I am planning to use GitHub to help me with my programming. :shipit:
Some things I have used GitHub for:
  - [x] Uploading files to save
  - [x] Made new branches so that I could make edits better
  - [x] Merged branches with pull requests

Also, GitHub has motivated me to:
  * learn the following Git commands:
  ```
  git status
  
  git remote add origin
  
  git commit
  
  git pull
  
  git add 
  
  git push
  ```
